# !Synthetic Data!
# -Data-cleaning-with-python
In this project, I helped fix issues in a call center's customer list to make sure their phone numbers were correct and easy to find. I used Python and Pandas in Jupyter to clean up the data and get it ready for use.

**Work Done**

-  Removed duplicate records to eliminate redundancies.
- Corrected formatting issues in names and phone numbers, stripping unwanted characters.
- Split full addresses into structured components such as street address, state, and zip code.
- Filtered out rows based on specific criteria, including consent flags ('Do_Not_Contact') and missing phone numbers.
- Standardized entries for consistency, such as converting 'Yes'/'No' to 'Y'/'N'.
